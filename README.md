## Our Goal

Study the concept of MVC, build a User data model. Repeat the transition and transfer of data via segway.

## What I created

If the login and password are entered correctly, a welcome screen opens, from which you can go to a screen with detailed information about the user, from which you can go to a screen with more detailed information. The user data is taken from the data model.
